## üß†üìä Continual Learning Challenge - CLVISION 2024 - 5th CLVISION CVPR Workshop

**Challenge Participation**  
We (in collaboration with Efstathios Karypidis) participated in the Continual Learning Challenge 2024, aiming at pushing the boundaries of continual learning techniques, addressing catastrophic forgetting, and improving model adaptation on sequential vision tasks.

### üí° Challenge Overview
It is fair to assume that data is not cheap to acquire, store and label in real-world machine learning applications. Therefore, it is crucial to develop strategies that are flexible enough to learn from streams of experiences, without forgetting what has been learned previously. Additionally, contextual unlabelled data can also be exploited to integrate additional information into the model.
