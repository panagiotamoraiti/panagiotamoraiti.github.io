## Jaco Robotic Arm â€“ Pick & Place with Computer Vision ðŸ¤–

**Internship Project @ Athena RC**  
We developed a simulation pipeline for a Kinova Jaco 6â€‘DOF robotic arm, integrating Unity and ROS with computer vision to perform real-world tasks like **leaf disease detection** and **garbage sorting**.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ What We Did

- **Unity + ROS Integration**  
  - Utilized Unity and ROS Noetic/Melodic to simulate and control the robotic arm  
  - Employed Gazebo and RViz for physics-based motion planning

- **Three Interactive Scenarios in Unity**  
  1. **Basic Pick & Place** â€“ A simple demo to move objects using the robotic arm  
  2. **Leaf Disease Detection** â€“ Detects grape leaves with disease using a **YOLOv4** model and sorts them accordingly  
  3. **Garbage Sorting** â€“ Uses object detection, **SSD MobileNetV2**, to classify and sort waste into categories: plastic, metal, paper, glass, unknown

### ðŸš€ Impact & Takeaways

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for robotic perception and manipulation.  

Key outcomes:

- Real-time computer vision in robotics
- Integration of Unity and ROS for simulation
- Real-world use cases: agriculture and sustainability
