## Jaco Robotic Arm ‚Äì Pick & Place with Computer Vision ü§ñ

**Internship Project @ Athena RC**  
We (in collaboration with Giannakopoulou Lamprini) developed a simulation pipeline for a Kinova Jaco 6‚ÄëDOF robotic arm, integrating Unity and ROS with computer vision to perform real-world tasks like **leaf disease detection** and **garbage sorting**.

### üéØ What We Did

- **Unity + ROS Integration**  
  - Utilized Unity and ROS Noetic/Melodic to simulate and control the robotic arm  
  - Employed Gazebo and RViz for physics-based motion planning

- **Three Interactive Scenarios in Unity**  
  1. **Basic Pick & Place** ‚Äì A simple demo to move objects using the robotic arm  
  2. **Leaf Disease Detection** ‚Äì Detects grape leaves with disease using a **YOLOv4** model and sorts them accordingly  
  3. **Garbage Sorting** ‚Äì Uses object detection, **SSD MobileNetV2**, to classify and sort waste into categories: plastic, metal, paper, glass, unknown
