## Continual Test-Time Adaptation - Domain Adaptation üß†üîÑ

**Dissertation Thesis Project**  
Supervisor: Professor Ioannis Pratikakis  
This project introduces a continual test-time adaptation method designed to handle domain shifts in real-world scenarios by adapting models on the fly without access to source data or retraining (Online Adaptation).

### üéØ Project Objectives

- **Project focuses on object detection task**

- **Address Real-world Domain Shifts**  
  - Develop techniques to adapt models to changing domains at test time  
  - Utilize unsupervised and self-supervised signals during inference  
  - Enhance robustness of models in dynamic environments  
  
- **Evaluation & Benchmarks**  
  - Evaluate on various benchmarks to demonstrate improvements (Shift, Cityscapes, Kitti, Clad, Coco)   
  - Compare against existing test-time adaptation methods, such as the Mean Teacher framework  

---

### üöÄ Key Contributions & Outcomes

- Designed a novel test-time adaptation approach specifically tailored for continual test-time adaptation scenarios  
- Achieved significant improvements over no adaptation and the Mean Teacher framework
- Proposed and evaluated on four benchmark datasets, simulating **continual domain shifts**  
- Published experimental setups and results can foster further research in the field
