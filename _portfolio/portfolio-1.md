## Continual Test-Time Adaptation - Domain Adaptation 🧠🔄

**Dissertation Thesis Project**  
This project introduces a continual test-time adaptation method designed to handle domain shifts in real-world scenarios by adapting models on the fly without access to source data or retraining (Online Adaptation).

### 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Project focuses on object detection task**

- **Address Domain Shift**  
  - Develop techniques to adapt models to changing input distributions at test time  
  - Utilize unsupervised and self-supervised signals during inference  
  - Enhance robustness of models in dynamic environments  
  
- **Evaluation & Benchmarks**  
  - Evaluate on various benchmarks to demonstrate improvements  
  - Compare against existing test-time adaptation methods, such as the Mean Teacher framework
